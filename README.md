<strong>Assignment</strong>




The first step is to incorporate the feedback you received on your Stage 3 assignment, making any needed corrections or adjustments.  (If you have not incorporated the feedback from your Stage 1 and Stage 2 assignments, you should do so prior to submitting Stage 4.) For this assignment, you will add Section IV to Sections I, II and III, as outlined below.   This assignment requires a complete BA&amp;SR document with revisions made as needed based on the Stage 1, 2, and 3 project submissions and feedback.  <strong>Note:</strong>  This is a specific grading criteria in the rubric.




Section IV of the Business Analysis and System Recommendation will propose an IT solution to meet CIC’s organizational strategy and meet its operational needs.  In Section IV, you will also Identify and explain the high-level steps that will need to take place in order to implement the system you have proposed.

Using the case study and the <strong>outline</strong> and <strong>resources</strong> listed below, develop your Section IV – System Recommendation.   Approximate lengths for each section are provided as a guideline; be sure to provide all pertinent information.




<ol>

 <li><strong>System Recommendation </strong></li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li><strong>Benefits of an Enterprise Solution:</strong> Explain what an enterprise system solution is in general (one paragraph) and how such a system would help CIC (one paragraph).  (Two complete paragraphs in total) <strong>Note:  </strong>Enterprise solutions are <strong>not</strong> the same as ERP applications.</li>

 <li><strong>Proposed IT Solution:</strong> There are many Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) HR systems available. Conduct some research on the web (using the search term “SaaS HR system”) and identify a system that will support and improve the hiring process at CIC and that <strong>meets the requirements</strong> you listed in Section III -Strategic and Operational Outcomes (the Stage 3 Assignment).  Be sure to evaluate potential solutions to align with the needs of CIC.  Identify the vendor and the system you selected and describe the basic functionality of the system. (One paragraph)</li>

 <li><strong>How the Proposed IT Solution Meets the Requirements:</strong> Using the 10 requirements you listed in your Stage 3 assignment (and incorporating any feedback you received), you will now explain how the solution you have chosen fulfills these requirements.</li>

</ol>

First, insert an introductory opening sentence for this section.  Then copy the entries for the 10 requirements you listed in the table in Section III (Stage 3 Assignment) into the Requirements column in the table below.  Complete the table by providing the explanations of how the system you selected meets each requirement.   (Provide an introductory sentence and copy the table and insert information within.)

<ol>

 <li><strong>Implementation Steps:</strong> First, insert an introductory opening sentence for this section. Then address each of the 7 implementation areas below by addressing the questions provided and identifying appropriate implementation steps.  (Do not include the questions in your paper.) Label each paragraph with the area being addressed for clarity. (one paragraph for each item)</li>

</ol>




<strong>Implementation Areas:</strong>




<ol>

 <li>Vendor agreement – What does CIC need to do to be able to start using the system? How much will it cost to use the system? [This information will come from vendor information located in your web research]</li>

 <li>Hardware and telecommunications

  <ol>

   <li>What hardware will CIC need to have to implement the solution? [vendor information]</li>

   <li>What kind of telecommunications will be needed for the solution, including local connectivity inside CIC and Internet access?</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Configuration

  <ol>

   <li>What options does the vendor offer for configuring the off-the-shelf system to CIC’s needs? [vendor information]</li>

   <li>How will the configuration be done and by whom?</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Testing – How will CIC test the system to see if it is working properly for its needs? Choose one of the ten requirements in Requirements (Section C) above and explain how this will be tested to ensure it is working properly and the requirement is met.</li>

 <li>Employee preparation – Identify what CIC will need to do in each of the following areas to prepare the employees (including the hiring managers in the various departments) to use the new system:

  <ol>

   <li>Leadership (2-3 sentences)</li>

   <li>Change Management (2-3 sentences)</li>

   <li>Training (2-3 sentences)</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Data migration – What existing data would need to be entered into the system to get started, and how might this be accomplished?</li>

 <li>Maintenance – Who will provide updates and corrections to the system?</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Close your Business Analysis and System Recommendation Report with a brief summary of the key points including the benefits CIC can expect to gain from this solution and the alignment with strategic objectives. (One well-written paragraph).</li>

</ol>

<strong>NOTE:</strong>  This final submission should be a cohesive Business Analysis and Systems Recommendation Report for the CIO of Chesapeake IT Consulting.  Sections I, II and III should have been updated to reflect substantive feedback received during the grading process.  The formatting should be consistent throughout the document, and the writing should flow well from beginning to end.  Headings, numbering, and footers should be correct for a final submission.  Although you prepared this in stages, the final product should not seem to be piecemeal or disconnected.




<strong>Formatting Your Assignment</strong>

For academic or business writing, the writer is expected to write in the third person. In third person, the writer avoids the pronouns I, we, my, and ours. The third person is used to make the writing more objective by taking the individual, the “self,” out of the writing. This method is very helpful for effective business writing, a form in which facts, not opinion, drive the tone of the text. Writing in the third person allows the writer to come across as unbiased and thus more informed.

<ul>

 <li>Write a complete, well organized paper that includes the four sections of the Business Analysis and System Recommendations (BA&amp;SR) report. Use the recommendations provided in each area for length of response. Content areas should be double spaced; table entries should be single-spaced. It’s important to value quality over quantity.  <strong>Length for Section IV should not exceed six (6) pages in addition to Sections I, II and III.</strong></li>

 <li>Ensure that each of the tables is preceded by an introductory sentence that explains what is contained in the table, so the reader understands <strong>why</strong> the table has been included.</li>

 <li>For Section IV, use <strong>at least three</strong> resources with APA formatted citation and reference. One reference must be from the vendor site for the solution you are recommending, one additional external source, and one from the IFSM 300 course content.  Course content should be from the class reading content, not the assignment instructions or case study itself.  The final document should contain all references from all stages appropriately formatted and alphabetized.</li>

 <li>Compare your work to the Grading Rubric below to be sure you have met content and quality criteria.</li>

 <li>Submit your paper as a Word document, or a document that can be read in Word.</li>

 <li>Your submission should include <strong><u>your last name first in the filename</u>: </strong><strong>Lastname_firstname_Stage_4</strong></li>

</ul>
